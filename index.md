## Project 1: Meet-Up Event Planner

You will build a responsive web application that allows the user to establish a meet-up event. The goal is to create an app that is a joy to use on both desktop and mobile. The application must allow someone to name their event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event.

## Project 2: Public Transportation App

You will build an application that allows users to select a departure and arrival train station, and see a list of trains, times, and durations. A default train schedule will be provided that should be used when the application is offline. If a network connection exists, the application will query an endpoint that provides information about all arrival and departure times.

## Project 3: Restaurant Reviewer

You will develop a restaurant review application with a focus on accessibility. You will remotely access JSON files containing restaurant information (including name, a photograph, address, cuisine type and operating hours) as well as JSON files containing review information for each restaurant (name of reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating and comments). The reviews application must include an application header, and a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants (by cuisine, by location, etc). When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

## Project 4: Corporate Dashboard

You must develop a corporate dashboard application using a front-end MVC framework of your choosing. The dashboard application must contain a header (with the currently selected dashboard’s name); a menu, allowing the user to navigate between dashboards; and the primary dashboard display area. You should find, or create, your own data files in CSV and JSON formats to provide data to the dashboards. The required dashboards are:

A geospatial view, identifying the number of employees at various company locations.
A “key metrics” view, containing components displaying: the number of open issues, a line chart reflecting number of paying customers over a period of time, and a bar chart reflecting number of reported issues over a period of time.
A “data view” of all issues, with an appearance similar to a spreadsheet, that is sortable and filterable.

## Project 5: Capstone Project - Drink Coffee

In this capstone project, students will build their own application using signature native application features such as device sensor access, offline-first, and more.
